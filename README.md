# Direct DIgital Synthesizer Design in Verilog

## What is DDS?
Direct digital synthesis (DDS) is a technique utilized by frequency synthesizers to generate arbitrary waveforms from a single, fixed-frequency reference clock. DDS finds application in signal generation, local oscillators for communication systems, function generators, mixers, modulators, sound synthesizers, and digital phase-locked loops.
